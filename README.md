# project-exrates

A university project, as part of a chosen 'Programming with Python' module. The aim of the coursework was to design and develop a 
system for efficient management of the historic currency exchange rates.  

The system consists of a module, containing most of the functionality, and several programs, allowing users to use all that functionality.
