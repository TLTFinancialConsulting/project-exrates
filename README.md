# project-exrates

This was a university project, as part of a chosen 'Programming with Python' module. The aim of the coursework was to design and develop a 
system for efficient management of the historic currency exchange rates. I used 'Open Exchange Rates' as a fantastic website source for fetched and saved data. (to use my programs one must register at https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free and obtain a unique app.id)

The system consists of a module, containing most of the functionality, and several programs, allowing users to use all that functionality.
